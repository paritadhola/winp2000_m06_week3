Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, running on everything from personal computers to large servers.

Linus, a Finnish computer science student, started developing Linux as a project like Unix. When he released it under the GNU General Public License, it grew into a global collaboration.

Over time, Linux has become widely used in systems like desktops, servers, and embedded devices, showcasing the power of open-source and community-driven development.Several user-friendly Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Red Hat made it easier for people to use and install Linux.

Today, Linux powers a variety of systems, including web servers, smartphones, and supercomputers. Its open-source nature has encouraged innovation, making it an important part of modern computing.
